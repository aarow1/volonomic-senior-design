Set rotor positions
For each rotor 1 direction perpendicular to position
  7 total nested for loops, 1 for each rotor direction
    Now you have set rotor positions and directions
    Construct controllability matrix, A
    Find the null space basis of A, this is the homogenous solution
      x_h = null space basis 
      if dim(null(A)) ~= 1, then move to next topology
      equivalently if dim(rowspace(A)) ~= 6, move to next topology
      all elements of x_h must be positive
        or if they are all negative, make them all positive      
    for each unit direciton of wrench, y
      calculate x_p using pseudo-inverse of A
      C = max(-x_p ./ x_h) // m = x_p + c * x_h
      m = x_p + c * x_h   // m is the motor speeds required to exert unit wrench y 
      d = max(m)          // d is the maximum motor speed to make unit wrench
      M = m / d           // M is the highest attainable motor speeds 
                          // to make wrench in y direction
                          // To explain: M has it's fastest motor speed set to 1
      R = A * M           // R is the highest attainable wrench in y direction
    find min(R) for topology
    store this with reference to specific topology
Choose topology with max(min(R))
